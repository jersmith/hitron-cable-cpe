# Cryptography: Keeping Secrets

A set of tools for learning classical and modern cryptography and cryptographic analysis techniques. This project is organized as a teaching tool with implementations interspersed with descriptions. It is not a replacement for more comprehensive texts on the subject, but provides a hands-on approach for those looking for examples and interaction.

*This is an initial draft in progress.*

## Getting Started

The best place to start is with the [tutorial](tutorial/classical.md). This covers the basic concepts of Classical Cryptopgraphy with examples of how to use the tools.

### Prerequisites

You need Python version 3+ to run the tools. There are no external dependencies.

### Running

You can run the `crypto` module directly or through a script wrapper. To run it directly:

```
python -m crypto
```
Through the wrapper:

```
./crypto
```

Running without arguments will give you the help for the command-line options.

There is also a wrapper for the `freq` module.
